I am a 4th-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at UCLA, advised by [Aditya Grover](https://aditya-grover.github.io/). Before my PhD, I spent two wonderful years at VinAI Research as an AI Resident, where I was fortunate enough to work under the supervision of [Dr. Hung Bui](https://sites.google.com/site/buihhung/) and collaborate with amazing colleagues [Rui Shu](https://ruishu.io/) and [Tuan Pham](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CmbSBmQAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research aims to develop large-scale foundation models in scientific domains, with a particular focus on tackling climate change and sustainability domains. Aside from research, I am a huge fan of football (soccer) and Manchester United.
